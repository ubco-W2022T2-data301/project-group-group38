## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
The objective of our project is to interpret Airbnb data to assist hosts with analytics and optimizing their listing. Every Airbnb host wants the their property to be booked at the best rate and for it to appear on the first page of search results. The greatest results are achieved by using a data-driven strategy combined with an Airbnb dynamic pricing tool. This will assist in identifying the weak points in the short-term rental plan and how to strengthen them. Reviewing the the most useful Airbnb statistics and analytics will increase the number of bookings and visibility of the listing on Airbnb. Our group found this topic thought provoking because property will always be an appreciating asset and the home development industry is on the rise. We would like to specifically explore how using a pricing tool compared to a conventional airbnb listing differ. Is it worth the service cost or is the host better off to figure out the market themselves? Our user-facing dashboard would be a powerful solution that suggests prices of the listing based on a set oof parameters. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
Our dataset is comprised of three files that have information on Airbnb reviews, scheduling, and listing data. Each of the files provided has detailed info regarding why people choose to stay where they stay, when they stay, and what amenities they prefer. This data can provide insight to the mind of the Hawaii'n tourist. The dataset has a combination of numbers and words, and will require some manual analysis to decipher what some of the reasons are for people saying what they say. It is quite extensive, with millions of data points to comb through. The data extends back to as far as 2005-2010, which will be data we use less than more timely, relevant data. There will also be key words we look for to find correlations and hidden trends that may be unbeknownst to the naked eye.
