**Person 1: Coleton Bilodeau**

I am interested in understanding what the most common factors are that create positive/negative reviews and how they impact the future bookings of the airbnb. I am particularly interested in a vacation destination and Hawaii is an excellent example of this. I am interested in a vacation destination as I am curious to know if owning a property and using airbnb is a potential form of passive income as well as an excellent getaway destination.

**Person 2: Anton Cizmok**

Similar to Coleton, I am interested in Hawaii as a vacation destination and plan on being a frequent traveler to the island. I am interested in what makes a good Airbnb versus a bad one, and to be able to create a dataset that can help me point my vacation planning in the right direction. A bunch of people I know also love to travel to Hawaii, so having an Airbnb guide on the best places to stay in the best locations and for the right reasons would be awesome to have as a tool in the future.
